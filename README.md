r-package for evolutionary biology

The package evobiR is a collection of R functions that I have developed for different projects.  The functions 
in this package can be loosely organized into either analysis of empirical data, simulation functions, or 
those created primarily for didactic purposes.  At the current time (October 2013) its still pretty rudimentary
but hopefully with time I will keep adding useful functions and speeding up existing ones.


To install the latest version of evobirR run the following lines in your R terminal.

You don't have the package devtools installed yet you will need to do that first:
install.packages("devtools")


library(devtools)
install_github("evobir", username='coleoguy')
library(evobiR)

for more info you can check out the evobiR website:
