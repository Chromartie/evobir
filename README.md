evolutionary biology in R

The package evobiR is a collection of R functions that I have developed for different projects.  The functions 
in this package can be loosely organized into either analysis of empirical data, simulation functions, or 
those created primarily for didactic purposes. 


evobiR is now on CRAN! This means that you can install as you would any other package
install.packages('evobiR')

If you want the very latest version of evobiR then you can install my developmental version from GitHub.

First install the package devtools if you dont have it yet:
install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools)

install_github('coleoguy/evobir')

library(evobiR)

if you have questions or problems please let me know
coleoguy@gmail.com.
